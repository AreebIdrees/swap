Swapping is a basic operation in programming that involves interchanging the values of two variables. A swap function is a reusable piece of code that simplifies the process of swapping values, making the code cleaner and more efficient.

What Is a Swap Function?
A swap function is a function that exchanges the values of two variables, typically passed as parameters. It's a common practice to pass variables by reference to modify their values directly within the function.

Why Use a Swap Function?
Using a swap function offers several advantages:

Readability: It makes the code more understandable by encapsulating the swapping logic in a single function.
Reusability: You can use the same swap function in multiple parts of your code, avoiding redundancy.
Safety: Swapping using a function reduces the risk of errors that can occur when manually swapping values.
Implementing a Swap Function
A swap function can be implemented in various programming languages. The following is a simple example in C++:
